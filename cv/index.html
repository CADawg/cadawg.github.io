					<h3>Personal Statement</h3>
				</header>
				<article>
					<p>
						My interest in computing first started at the age of nine when I taught myself how to code, since then my curiosity and enthusiasm has catapulted. I love the idea of being able to make a computer do anything that I can imagine. The first programming language that I learnt was Visual Basic, then after I got to grips with that I learnt about Python, which I find thoroughly useful. To this day I am still learning new programming languages.
					</p>
					<p>
						I think that I am a very logical person because I enjoy problem-solving, which is highly useful in Software Development. Whilst on work experience at Hydro Group, this year, I used SQL databases, Visual Basic and Excel. My supervisor said that I exceeded all expectations and that I flew through the tasks that I was set. He also said that I was welcome back for work experience anytime and that if any jobs were to come up in the future he would email me. After my work experience, I felt even more driven to do Software Development. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In school I have been a member of the Build a Computer club since S1; recently I have become part of their leadership team. In this club pupils get a chance to see inside computers, take them apart and create software for them. I have also been a part of the Enterprise club where we come up with ideas on how to raise money for charity, vote on which charity should benefit and then put these ideas into action. I have also just completed my bronze Duke of Edinburghâ€™s award. Outside of school I enjoy Karate; I am currently a green belt.
